# vrf-solidity [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vrf-solidity.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vrf-solidity) [![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/witnet/vrf-solidity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/witnet/vrf-solidity)

`vrf-solidity` is an open source fast and effective implementation of Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) written in Solidity. More precisely, this library implements verification functions for VRF proofs based on the Elliptic Curve (EC) `Secp256k1`.

_DISCLAIMER: This is experimental software. **Use it at your own risk**!_

The solidity library has been designed aiming at decreasing gas consumption and its complexity due to EC operations.

It provides two main `pure` functions for verifying VRF proofs:

- **verify**:
  - _Description_: VRF *full* verification (requires heavy EC computation)
  - _Inputs_:
    - *_publicKey*: The public key as an array composed of `[pubKey-x, pubKey-y]`
    - *_proof*: The VRF proof as an array composed of `[gamma-x, gamma-y, c, s]`
    - *_message*: The message (in bytes) used for computing the VRF
  - _Output_:
    - true, if VRF proof is valid
- **fastVerify**:
  - _Description_: VRF *fast* verification by providing additional EC points. It uses the `ecrecover` precompiled function to verify EC multiplications (lower gas consumption).
  - _Inputs_:
    - *_publicKey*: The public key as an array composed of `[pubKey-x, pubKey-y]`
    - *_proof*: The VRF proof as an array composed of `[gamma-x, gamma-y, c, s]`
    - *_message*: The message (in bytes) used for computing the VRF
    - *_uPoint*: The `u` EC point defined as `U = s*B - c*Y`
    - *_vComponents*: The components required to compute `v` as `V = s*H - c*Gamma`
  - _Output_:
    - true, if VRF proof is valid

Additionally, the library provides some auxiliary `pure` functions to facilitate computing the aforementioned input parameters:

- **decodeProof**:
  - _Description_: Decode from bytes to VRF proof
  - _Input_:
    - *_proof*: The VRF proof as bytes
  - _Output_:
    - The VRF proof as an array composed of `[gamma-x, gamma-y, c, s]`
- **decodePoint**:
  - _Description_: Decode from bytes to EC point
  - _Input_:
    - *_point*: The EC point as bytes
  - _Output_:
    - The point as `[point-x, point-y]`
- **computeFastVerifyParams**:
  - _Description_: Compute the parameters (EC points) required for the VRF fast verification function
  - _Inputs_:
    - *_publicKey*: The public key as an array composed of `[pubKey-x, pubKey-y]`
    - *_proof*: The VRF proof as an array composed of `[gamma-x, gamma-y, c, s]`
    - *_message*: The message (in bytes) used for computing the VRF
  - _Output_:
    - The fast verify required parameters as the tuple `([uPointX, uPointY], [sHX, sHY, cGammaX, cGammaY])`
- **gammaToHash**:
  - _Description_: Computes the VRF hash output as result of the digest of a ciphersuite-dependent prefix concatenated with the gamma point. This hash can be used for deterministically generating verifiable pseudorandom numbers.
  - _Inputs_:
    - *_gammaX*: The x-coordinate of the gamma EC point
    - *_gammaY*: The y-coordinate of the gamma EC point
  - _Output_:
    - The VRF hash ouput as shas256 digest

## Elliptic Curve VRF (using `Secp256k1`)

This library follows the algorithms described in [VRF-draft-04](https://tools.ietf.org/pdf/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-04) in order to provide the VRF verification capability.

The supported cipher suite is `SECP256K1_SHA256_TAI`, i.e. the aforementioned algorithms using `SHA256` as digest function and the `secp256k1` curve. For the VRF algorithms the cipher suite code used is `0xFE`.

For elliptic curve arithmetic operations `vrf-solidity` uses the `elliptic-curve-solidity` library.

## Usage

`VRF.sol` library can be used directly by importing it.

Similarly to the [`VRFTestHelper.sol`](https://github.com/witnet/vrf-solidity/blob/master/test/VRFTestHelper.sol) from the [`test`][test-folder] project folder, a contract may use the library by instantiation as follows:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.6.4;

import "vrf-solidity/contracts/VRF.sol";


contract VRFTestHelper {

  function functionUsingVRF(
    uint256[2] memory public _publicKey,
    uint256[4] memory public _proof,
    bytes memory _message)
  public returns (bool)
  {
    return VRF.verify(_publicKey, _proof, _message);
  }
}
```

The tests under the [`test`][test-folder] folder can be seen as additional examples for interacting with the contract using Solidity and Javascript.

## Benchmark

Gas consumption analysis was conducted in order  to understand the associated costs to the usage of the `vrf-solidity` library. Only `public` functions were object of study as they are the only functions meant to be called by other parties.

The three auxiliary public functions (`decodeProof`, `decodePoint` and `computeFastVerifyParams`) are recommended to be used (if possible) as off-chain operations, so that there is not gas costs.
